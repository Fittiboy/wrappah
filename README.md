## Wrappah
### Requirements
pyautogui, pyperclip
### What in the world is this????
A buddy of mine started asking: 'What's "my message here"?' whenever I said something on Discord, so I made a script that does it faster than him.  
Triple click a message in Discord and hit ctrl+c. With the script running in the background, it will wrap it for you and immediately paste it and send it!
